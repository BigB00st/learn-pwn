# learn-pwn
Pwn challenges for learning purposes. Intended for beginners.

## Objective
The objective in each challenge is to cause the executable to print the flag file.

## Rules / Tips
1. Don't cheat. Find the solution by yourself.
2. The flag must be printed by the executable (not debugger), and the executable must not be patched.
3. Brute force solutions are forbidden.
4. Google is your best friend.
5. The intended solution is located in each challenge's directory. If you find a different solution, feel free to contribute by creating a PR.
6. Challenges are not intended to be solved with LD_PRELOAD, except challenge "ld-preload".
7. Feel free to post solutions online.
